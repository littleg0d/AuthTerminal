# 🔐 AuthTerminal: Encrypted 2FA Authenticator for your Terminal

A command-line (CLI) tool for managing your two-factor authentication (2FA / TOTP) codes right in your terminal.

Your secrets are stored in a local, strongly encrypted file protected by a master password that only you know.

* **Dynamic Display:** Shows your codes in a clean, auto-aligning list.
* **Auto-Refresh:** Codes and the time bar update in real-time every second.
* **Simple Import:** Easily add new accounts from a `.txt` file containing `otpauth://` URIs.

🚀 Usage


### 🗝️ 1. First-Time Setup (Create Encrypted Vault)

Before viewing any codes, you must import your accounts to create your encrypted vault.

```bash
Create a .txt file (e.g. my_keys.txt) with your otpauth:// URIs, one per line.
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** This command only works with plain `.txt` or `json` files containing `otpauth://` URIs.  
> It **cannot import or decrypt already encrypted vault files**.  
> To view or modify an existing vault, just run `python auth.py` instead.



Run the import command:
```bash
python auth.py importar my_keys.txt
```

The script will:

Ask you to create a master password.

Import your accounts and encrypt them into a new file secrets.json.

### 👀 2. View Your 2FA Codes

Once you have imported your secrets, view your codes with:
```bash
python auth.py
```

You’ll be prompted for your master password.

The screen will show a real-time list of your codes with a refreshing timer bar.

Press Ctrl + C to exit the viewer.

### ➕ 3. Import More Accounts

To add new accounts later:
```bash
python auth.py importar another_file.txt
```

The tool unlocks your vault using your master password.

New secrets are added; duplicates are automatically ignored.

The vault is re-encrypted and saved.

### 🔄 4. Change Your Master Password

If you want to change your master password:
```bash
python auth.py cambiarpass
```

You’ll be prompted to:

Enter your current password.

Enter and confirm your new password.

Your vault will be re-encrypted with the new password.
